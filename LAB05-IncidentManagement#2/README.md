#### ðŸŽ“ Level: 300 (Intermediate)
#### âŒ› Estimated time to complete this lab: 40 minutes

This exercise guides you through the SOC Analyst objects and Rule and train you how to use Azure sentinel tools and features in an incident response drill.

#### Prerequisites
This module relay on completing LAB01-Setup part, as the data and the artifacts that we will be using in this module need to be deployed on your sentinel instance.

### Exercise 1: Review Azure Sentinel incident tools and capabilities
As a SOC analyst the entry point to consume Security incidents(tickets) in Sentinel is the Incident page.
1.  in the left navigation menu press on the incident and open the incident page.
this page will show by default all the open incident in the last 24hr.
2. When we want to change the time window, present only incident from specific severity or to see also closed incident, we can use the filters bar

3. On the incident page select the "Model Evasion in Critical ML model" incident.
in the right pane you can see the incident preview with the high level information on the incident. 

4.As you are the SME SOC analyst that deal and investigate fraud tickets, you need to take ownership on this incident.
on the right page change the unassigned to "Assign to me" and also change the status from New to active.
